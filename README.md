# Smart-Gas-Detection-System
The system is designed to enhance worker safety in environments with toxic gases, such as sewers, by using a network of transmitters and a central receiver. Workers wear transmitters with gas sensors and alerting features (LED lights, buzzers, vibration), while a supervisor operates the central receiver (equipped with a display, LEDs, buzzers) outside. The system can detect methane, butane, carbon monoxide, ammonia, benzene, hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide, trigger warnings, and enable bidirectional communication. The transmitter are also designed to alert the workers and the receiver if the sensors are faulty. In event of any danger, the supervisor can alert the workers for immediate withdrawal.  Moreover, the system can be used in other hazardous environments such as mines and fire-fighting. Additionally, the data collected is transmitted to a central database for maintenance planning, new projects and research, contributing to the development of smart cities. A spatial database of the degree of presence of harmful gases will contribute in making concerted efforts to create a healthy city.
NOTE: IT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THE MINIMUM PROTOTYPE IS SHOWN HERE.
